<p>For people who want to become a ninja like Ninja, what are some things they can do? </p>

	<h1>Ninja: First, you have to become the enemy. If a thief breaks into your house, they are the one who must be fucked. If someone tries to rob you or kill you, it should be the biggest mistake of their life.</h1>

<p>
I read that one of the astronauts on the International Space Station is a big Die Antwoord fan. I bet the space station never gets robbed.</p>

<h2>Yo-Landi: They're bumping our shit on the moon.</h2>

	<h1>Ninja: In outer space. Are you joking? I say to them, "How's it hanging?"</h1>


<p>If you were a sex toy, what would you be? Who would you be used on?</p>

		<h2>Yo-Landi: A dolphin.</h2>

	<h1>Ninja: Yeah, a dolphin. A real dolphin. That would be nice. I'd be used on you, Trent, I'd fuck you in the ass!</h1>

<p>People can't figure Die Antwoord out. They don't know whether to love you or hate you, or to be attracted to you or disgusted. They don't know if you're dumb or genius. You make what you do look easy.</p>

<p>What blows your mind?</p>

	<h1>Ninja: I like getting mind-fucked by things. It's very rare. That kind of pure reaction. I want to do that, to bewilder and be bewildered. I want to make songs that make people think, "What the fuck was that?" I wish people did this more often.</h1>


<p>What blows your mind?</p>

		<h2>Yo-Landi: The video for Duck Sauce's "Big Bad Wolf" blew my mind. Have you seen it?</h2>

	<h1>Ninja: I started crying, seriously, when I saw this video. It made me so happy that there were other people doing weirder things. Things that are on our level. Whoever is reading this, watch this video. We went to visit that fucking weirdo Marilyn Manson, and we played him the video, and he was like, "Where did you guys find this? I love it." We said, "We found it on the fucking interwebs, dude."</h1>

<p>Talk about visiting Marilyn Manson. Did he have the one scary contact lens in?</p>

		<h2>Yo-Landi: We went to his house, and he wouldn't let us leave. He locked the door and hid the key. I think he had the contact in, I don't know. He made us drink a lot of this stuff called absinthe. He makes his own brand in Switzerland. It's called Mansinthe. It has 66.6 percent alcohol. He lives in this house-castle, and it's all black inside. There's no light. He has a cinema, and a studio, and all these paintings, and a bar serving only absinthe. He got us really drunk and then asked Ninja to spray-paint something on the ceiling above his bed.</h2>

<p>What did you spray-paint above his bed? Die Antwoord should do a song with Marilyn Manson.</p>

	<h1>Ninja: I spray-painted an evil boy. I was so drunk, I didn't know what to do. We tried to do a song with him! It would be peachy. We went into his studio and everything. But we were just too fucking drunk. I couldn't stop laughing. It sounded stupid. Maybe we'll try again. Marilyn Manson is a warped-ass motherfucker. I love him.</h1>

<p>What do you all think of Justin Bieber?</p>

	<h1>Ninja: Justin Bieber is cool. Kids out here are totally obsessed with him. </h1>

<p>That surprises me, Ninja. I would think you wouldn't like Justin Bieber.</p>

	<h1>Ninja: Why? He's just a cute little kid. He's doing his thing. He's a sweetheart. It was a little stupid of Ludacris to rap such a dork verse on his song, but Justin Bieber is cool.</h1>

<p>Could Justin Bieber someday become a ninja?</p>

	<h1>Ninja: Maybe. He's too much of a pretty boy now. He's a kid. Not ugly enough to be a ninja. I don't know if he has what it takes. He's Walt Disney and shit, man.</h1>

<p>If you were to train Justin Bieber to become a ninja like yourself, what would you make him do?</p>

	<h1>Ninja: I'd make him cut his face open on both sides like a Zulu warrior. Then he'd have to circumcise himself and live for five months in the bush. Then we would hunt hyenas. If he doesn't run away and get scared, we can take him to the next level.</h1>
