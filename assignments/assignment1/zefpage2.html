	<p>Let's do some wordplay. I'll say a word, and you all say the first thing that comes to your mind.</p>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: Kick it.</h2>

	<p>Corn dog.</p>

		<h1>Ninja: I don't know what the fuck that is. I'm from South Africa. A dog made out of corn?</h1>

	<p>It's a hot dog on a stick, surrounded by breading, corn bread.</p>

		<h1>Ninja: Where's the corn?</h1>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: Why is it on a stick?</h2>

	<p>Next word: urethra.</p>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: What did you say?</h2>

		<h1>Ninja: A venereal disease?</h1>

	<p>It's the tube in our bodies that carries off the urine from the bladder.</p>

		<h1>Ninja: I say biology class.</h1>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: I say Aretha Franklin. And linguini.</h2>

	<p>Next word: fetish.</p>

		<h1>Ninja: Hot-air ballooning.</h1>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: Catfish.</h2>

	<p>Bacon grease.</p>

		<h1>Ninja: We're vegetarian.</h1>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: Hot-air ballooning.</h2>

	<p>How does Die Antwoord write songs?</p>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: We don't have a recipe or a specific mixture. We have an idea, like a name or a chorus, and we'll fuck with it for a day or two days, and we'll finish writing. Or sometimes we'll fuck with it for like a month, until the right thing comes up. But there's always an idea, or a mood, or a word as a starting place, then we flow out of that. The music, and the beats, and rhyming is based on the mood of the song that we want to explore. But it's always mysterious how songs happen. I can't really tell you, "This is what we do" or "This is what we don't do." It can be complex, over a period of time. Or it can be simple and come together in seconds.</h2>

		<h1>Ninja: Sometimes it's really fucking easy. And sometimes it's really fucking difficult. I think of Yo-Landi's method as being accidental. She likes to mess with stuff, to break it down, to take things apart and see how they come back together.</h1>

	<p>What's an example of one of these moods?</p>

		<h1>Ninja: The introduction on the new album. I wanted it to be like The Lion King. Like you are in Africa. Lion King mixed with apocalyptic warfare, kind of the vibe of Africa at the moment. Then we move to the next track and the next mood, "I Fink U Freeky." I wanted that one to be like music at a party or someone partying in the parking lot playing music loud out of the trunk of their car, something people could fucking get down to. We wanted to see how pop we could get and how dark we could get. The video for "I Fink U Freeky" is just that, as dark and pop as we could conjure. For "Fatty Boom Boom," we wanted it to be a soundtrack to a voodoo ceremony.</h1>

	<p>"Fatty Boom Boom" is my favorite song on Ten$ion.</p>

		<h1>Ninja: We're doing a video for that one next. It was such an accident, the rhythm of that song. Such a freak-out. I made this retarded beat box. We were like, "Jesus." And we tried to get all these drummers and shit to play it. And they were like, "What the fuck are you doing?" We wanted to get a live drummer to play it, but no drummers could play it. Then DJ Hi-Tek broke it down and made a beat out of it.</h1>

	<p>Where did you all record the album?</p>

		<h1>Ninja: At Hi-Tek's studio in Cape Town.</h1>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: Before we decided to drop Interscope records, we got a bunch of money, and Hi-Tek went from recording in his bedroom to having a real studio with a lounge, with a proper sound booth and shit. And good microphones. We don't have to record next to his stinky mattress anymore, with panties all around. And he still makes us buy him lunch and coffee. He never wants to pay for shit.</h2>

	<p>What do you think of the United States? Do you like it here?</p>

			<h2>Yo-Landi: Yeah, we like it. It's so fucking organized. Jesus, it's like the most organized shit ever. And people make sense when they talk. Like you. I like you. If someone tells you something, you understand it perfectly. Everyone is so nice and polite. And then we ask them to enter the dark depths of Die Antwoord. Let's have some Mansinthe. Wait, so we have a question for you. What does it mean in America when you say "Jimmy crack corn"? Eminem has a song about it. Is it about being corny? Or because he's a cracker? What the fuck does that mean?</h2>

	<p>There's multiple meanings. It's slang meaning to either sit around chatting or crack open a bottle of liquor, corn liquor back in the day. It's from an old song that dates back to the 1840s, an ugly time in our country's history. What is Die Antwoord's deepest darkest fantasy?</p>

		<h1>Ninja: Like, we living it, Nigga.</h1>

	<p>What does Die Antwoord have to say to all the people who think you are a joke?</p>

		<h1>Ninja: I say they are totally right. I laugh myself to sleep every night.	We'll see them at the show.<h1>

			<h2>  Yo-Landi [singing]: Wankeeee. </h2>
